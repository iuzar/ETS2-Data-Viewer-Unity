# ETS2-Data-Viewer-Unity
A simple software to connect the the ETS2 Telemetry Server, and view data such as Cargo, Distance to delivery, ETA (in game time) and estimated Real Time ETA (based on the calculated game Time Scale). It also displays the speed limit and you can toggle between NOK support (Norwegian currency) for ETS2 Scandinavian DLC support.

It runs on 10 fps, as not more is needed for a nice steady update of information.
It connects to [@Funbit's](https://github.com/Funbit/) [Telemetry Server](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server) and fetches the JSON and parses it with [NewtonSoft](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).
